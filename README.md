Port Authority Forecasting & Analysis Dashboard is an advanced Qlik Sense application designed to provide comprehensive insights into transportation trends and ridership forecasts. This tool leverages cutting-edge analytics to support data-driven decisions in public transportation planning and management.


This dashboard follows the DAR (Dashboard, Analysis, Report) approach, offering stakeholders an intuitive platform to monitor key metrics, analyze sector correlations, and access in-depth reports. Through predictive modeling, this tool projects key metrics like bus departures and passenger counts, helping forecast future trends.

Key Features:
1. KPI Monitoring and Trend Analysis:
Track key performance indicators across sectors, focusing on critical metrics for passenger counts and bus departures. Access real-time insights into operational performance.

2. Sector Correlation Analysis:
Examine the relationships between bus ridership, commodity prices, and economic uncertainty. Our correlation model reveals that while oil prices donâ€™t directly affect bus frequency, ridership shows a notable correlation with the Uncertainty Index, highlighting market dependencies.

3. Forecasting Models:
Utilize Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for sophisticated forecasting directly within Qlik Sense. Our model predicts that passenger targets (125k) will be met by December 23, 2024, and bus departure targets (3.9k) by December 12, 2027.

4. Interactive Dashboards for Bus and Passenger Analysis:
Customize your data visualization with filters by bus company and year, allowing for targeted analysis of multiple companies over various years. Gain actionable insights from OLS Time Series Forecasting for strategic planning.

5. Economic Insights on Ridership Dynamics:
Get a clear view of how macroeconomic uncertainty impacts passenger volume, aiding in scenario-based planning and resilience strategies for public transportation.
